<h2 class="text-yellow">Cookies and web beacons</h2>
<hr class="custom-horizontal">
<p class="text-normal">
  A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier,
  which is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.
  Cookies are required to use some Elaka services. Elaka and its Ad Partners use cookies to record
  current session information.
</p>

<p class="text-normal">
  Our Ad Partners may also from time to time use web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs).
  These web beacons are provided by our Ad Partners and allow Ad Partners to obtain information such as the IP
  address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which
  the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page
  and the information in cookies set by the Ad Partners. Web beacons enable our Ad Partners to recognize a unique
  cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.
</p>

<p class="text-normal">
  With both cookies and web beacon technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not
  personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
</p>

<p class="text-normal">
  You can opt-out of Google Analytics data collection with the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You
  can opt out of Ad Partner information collection using the process described in the Your information sale
  opt-out right section of this policy.
